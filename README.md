## Dataset
Airlines Flights Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data/data)

## Why did I chose this dataset?
I chose the Airlines Flights Data because I recently came back from a few trips where I had to take the plane. I was fascinated by the intricate systems pilots and other employees have to be familiar with at the airport. I am interested in learning more about the data they have to know about on a daily basis.

- [x] Question 5: Does price vary with departure time?
  - Answer: Yes, the analyzed data suggests that there is a relationship between departure times and pricing of flights. It appears that the cheapest flights have their departure time at night for LCCs, and morning-afternoon for FSCs. The most expensive flights have a departure time in the morning for LCCs, while the most expensive FSC flights generally have a departure time at night.

- [x] Question 7: Does price change based on the source city?
